# AFL Games Simulation
This repository contains the source code that simulates the simple version of AFL Games. This project was part of FIT1051-A3 Oct-2023.


## Information
> Run the "GameDriver.java" file, alongside the others, to run the simulation successfully. Note that only some specific inputs are valid.
> ESSENTIALS folder contains other files required to be in the same directory as the driver class.


## Restrictions
The project was made with consideration of restrictions to user inputs, which may throw errors when some inputs are unexpected/invalidated. Some of them require specific input format, and it won't be covered under this repository. This repository serves the purpose of archiving some of my older projects during the FIT1051 unit.


### Final Score: 97.5 / 100 (High Distinction)
