# Restaurant simulation
This repository contains the source code that simulates the program "Restaurant Simulation". This project was part of FIT1051-A4 Oct-2023. 

## Information
> Run the "RestaurantDriver.java" file, alongside the others, to run the simulation successfully. Note that only some specific inputs are valid.
> ESSENTIALS folder contains other files that must be ran together with the driver class.


## Restrictions
The project was made with consideration of restrictions to user inputs, which may throw errors when some inputs are unexpected/invalidated. Some of them require specific input format, and it won't be covered under this repository. This repository serves the purpose of archiving some of my older projects during the FIT1051 unit.

### Final Score: 97 / 100 (High Distinction)
